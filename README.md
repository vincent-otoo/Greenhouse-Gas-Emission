# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Analysis (1750–2022)

This project explores global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions trends from **1750 to 2022**, with a special focus on **Africa** — particularly **West African countries**. Using historical emissions data, the analysis aims to uncover patterns across **continents**, **income groups**, and **individual countries**, highlighting regional contributors and long-term trends.

---

## 📊 Key Objectives

- Analyze global CO₂ emissions from 1750–2022.
- Compare emissions by **continent**, **income group**, and **country**.
- Zoom in on **Africa**, with detailed focus on **West Africa**.
- Identify the **top 10 CO₂ emitters in West Africa** from 2000–2022.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas** – data wrangling and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – exploratory analysis  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Global emissions have increased sharply since the industrial revolution, with most growth concentrated in high-income countries.
- Annual CO₂ emission across the various continents in the year 2022 was identified abd visualized, with **North America** recording the highest, followed by **Africa**
- From 2000–2022, the top CO₂ emitters in West Africa were identified and visualized, offering insights into regional policy planning.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to preprocess and clean large-scale time series datasets
- How to group and filter data for regional and categorical comparisons
- How to avoid assumptions and ensure meaningful segmentation (e.g., by income group or region)
- How to visualize long-term emissions trends using line plots and bar charts

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Add interactive visualizations (e.g., using Plotly or Dash)
- Build a dashboard for stakeholders to explore emissions by region and year
- Perform forecasting using time-series models
